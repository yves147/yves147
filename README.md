## Interests
Algorithmics and applied computer science in the form of simulations, analyses and complex factual contexts. Most likeable for me is providing a solution to real-world problems or philosophising about theoretical computer science.
## Projects
Be it because of the sealing of certain work related to the profession or because of my own reticence to publish some projects, you may see a lot of my personal projects are not public. I regularly participate in some competitions regarding math, cs, ai or creative solutions, which are mainly national competitions or hackathons.
Some of my weekend projects include a participation at the #WirVSVirus Hackathon, a Homework-Application for my school during Corona, my own peer-to-peer network system etc. pp.
