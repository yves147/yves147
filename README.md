## Work
I regularly participate in competitions regarding math, cs, ai or creative solutions. Currently im studying math during school @ University Duisburg-Essen as a so called Early Student. Some of my weekend projects include a top 30 participation at the #WirVSVirus Hackathon, a Homework-Application for my school during Corona, my own peer-to-peer network system and a lot of microcontrolling.
